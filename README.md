# Land-of-Rising-Sun-Map-to-SA-MP-0.3.DL

It's a conversion of Land of Rising Sun map that was created by Touge Team for their MTA Project (LOTRS). As SA-MP 0.3.DL was released, I recieved a permision from them to made a map conversion to SA-MP 0.3.DL and use it for my project (17-K DRIFT)

Land of Rising Sun is set in Japan.

**Know Issues:**
* A few objects have problems with collision due to their geometry.
